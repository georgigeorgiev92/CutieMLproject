The vocab.txt is not generated by the program. But the other files *_classes.npy, *_dictionary.npy, *_word_to_index.npy and *_index_to_word.npy are generated by the main_data_loader.py file

The _dress_text (data_loader_json.py) function uses the vocab.txt to look for known words and uses it for word piece tokenization. Refer BERT model.
You can add the words that you want to be included in your output in vocab.txt manually or through some scripts.
To create dictionary from training data, you can simply execute the main_dict_json.py file. You may have to configure the parameters to accommodate your input though, but the default one works too.
